![Agent Platform Swarm](/docs/platform-agents-swarm.png)

Agents in Archestra provide a comprehensive no-code solution for building autonomous and semi-autonomous agents that can access your data and work together in swarms. Each agent consists of a User Prompt, System Prompt, assigned tools, and sub-agents, and can be triggered via:
- Archestra Chat UI
- A2A (Agent-to-Agent) protocol
- [Microsoft Teams](/docs/platform-ms-teams)
- Email

## A2A (Agent-to-Agent)

A2A is a JSON-RPC 2.0 gateway that allows external systems to invoke agents programmatically. Each Prompt exposes two endpoints:

- **Agent Card Discovery**: `GET /v1/a2a/:promptId/.well-known/agent.json`
- **Message Execution**: `POST /v1/a2a/:promptId`

### Authentication

All A2A requests require Bearer token authentication. Generate tokens via the Profile's API key settings or use team tokens for organization-wide access.

### Agent Card

The discovery endpoint returns an AgentCard describing the agent's capabilities:

```json
{
  "name": "My Agent",
  "description": "Agent description from prompt",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "capabilities": {
    "streaming": false,
    "pushNotifications": false
  },
  "defaultInputModes": ["text"],
  "defaultOutputModes": ["text"],
  "skills": [{ "id": "default", "name": "Default Skill" }]
}
```

### Sending Messages

Send JSON-RPC 2.0 requests to execute the agent:

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.example.com/v1/a2a/<promptId>" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "id": "1",
    "method": "message/send",
    "params": {
      "message": {
        "parts": [{ "kind": "text", "text": "Hello agent!" }]
      }
    }
  }'
```

Response:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": "1",
  "result": {
    "messageId": "msg-...",
    "role": "agent",
    "parts": [{ "kind": "text", "text": "Agent response..." }]
  }
}
```

### Delegation Chain

A2A supports nested agent-to-agent calls. When one agent invokes another, the delegation chain tracks the call path for observability. This enables multi-step agent workflows where agents can use other agents as tools.

### Configuration

A2A uses the same LLM configuration as Chat. See [Deployment - Environment Variables](/docs/platform-deployment#environment-variables) for the full list of `ARCHESTRA_CHAT_*` variables.

## Incoming Email

Incoming Email allows external users to invoke agents by sending emails to auto-generated addresses. Each Prompt gets a unique email address using plus-addressing (e.g., `mailbox+agent-<promptId>@domain.com`).

When an email arrives:

1. Microsoft Graph sends a webhook notification to Archestra
2. Archestra extracts the Prompt ID from the recipient address
3. The email body becomes the agent's input message
4. The agent executes and generates a response
5. Optionally, the agent's response is sent back as an email reply

### Conversation History

When processing emails that are part of a thread (replies), Archestra automatically fetches the conversation history and provides it to the agent. This allows the agent to understand the full context of the conversation and respond appropriately to follow-up messages.

### Email Reply

When email replies are enabled, the agent's response is automatically sent back to the original sender. The reply:

- Maintains the email conversation thread
- Uses the original message's "Re:" subject prefix
- Displays the agent's name as the sender

### Prerequisites

- Microsoft 365 mailbox (Exchange Online)
- Azure AD application with `Mail.Read` application permission
- Publicly accessible webhook URL

### Azure AD Application Setup

1. Create an App Registration in [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_RegisteredApps/ApplicationsListBlade)
2. Add the following **application** permissions (not delegated) under Microsoft Graph:
   - `Mail.Read` - Required for receiving emails
   - `Mail.Send` - Required for sending reply emails (optional)
3. Grant admin consent for the permissions
4. Create a client secret and note the value

### Configuration

Set these environment variables (see [Deployment](/docs/platform-deployment#incoming-email-configuration) for details):

```bash
ARCHESTRA_AGENTS_INCOMING_EMAIL_PROVIDER=outlook
ARCHESTRA_AGENTS_INCOMING_EMAIL_OUTLOOK_TENANT_ID=<tenant-id>
ARCHESTRA_AGENTS_INCOMING_EMAIL_OUTLOOK_CLIENT_ID=<client-id>
ARCHESTRA_AGENTS_INCOMING_EMAIL_OUTLOOK_CLIENT_SECRET=<client-secret>
ARCHESTRA_AGENTS_INCOMING_EMAIL_OUTLOOK_MAILBOX_ADDRESS=agents@yourcompany.com
```

### Webhook Setup

**Option 1: Automatic** - Set `ARCHESTRA_AGENTS_INCOMING_EMAIL_OUTLOOK_WEBHOOK_URL` and the subscription is created on server startup.

**Option 2: Manual** - Navigate to Settings > Incoming Email and enter your webhook URL.

Microsoft Graph subscriptions expire after 3 days. Archestra automatically renews subscriptions before expiration.

### Email Address Format

Agent email addresses follow the pattern:

```
<mailbox-local>+agent-<promptId>@<domain>
```

For example, if your mailbox is `agents@company.com` and your Prompt ID is `abc12345-6789-...`, emails sent to:

```
agents+agent-abc123456789...@company.com
```

will invoke that specific agent.

### Security Modes

Incoming email is disabled by default for all agents. When enabled, you must choose a security mode to control who can invoke the agent via email.

| Mode | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Private** | Only registered Archestra users who have team-based access to the agent can invoke it. The sender's email address must match an existing user, and that user must be a member of at least one team assigned to the agent. **Note:** This mode relies on your email provider's sender verification. Email addresses can be spoofed—ensure your provider has appropriate anti-spoofing measures (SPF, DKIM, DMARC) configured. |
| **Internal** | Only emails from a specified domain are accepted. Configure an allowed domain (e.g., `company.com`) to restrict access to your organization's email addresses. Note: This performs an exact domain match—subdomains are not automatically included (e.g., if `company.com` is allowed, emails from `sub.company.com` will be rejected). |
| **Public** | Any email address can invoke the agent. Use with caution as this exposes the agent to external senders. |

When security validation fails, the email is rejected with an appropriate error and no agent execution occurs.
